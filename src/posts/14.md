I never actually use 4chan before, but I found the greentext format to be quite interesting for story telling. So this time I will try writing a blog in this style, hope you enjoy!

## [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; be me<br/>
  &gt; just switch from windows 10 to kde neon<br/>
  &gt; fall in love with it customizability<br/>
  &gt; discover <a class="text-success" href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs.html">xah blog about emacs</a><br/>
  &gt; also pp say that its the most customizable text editor<br/>
  &gt; install it<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; emacs also come with a shitty tui and a clutter gui<br/>
  &gt; i minimize and customize the gui<br/>
  &gt; emacs is now as good as the default text editor that come with the de<br/>
  &gt; try out <a class="text-success" href="https://www.spacemacs.org">spacemacs</a><br/>
  &gt; dont like it<br/>
  &gt; its slow and way more bloat<br/>
  &gt; decide to rice emacs from scratch<br/>
  &gt; drown myself in the <a class="text-success" href="https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs">awesome emacs list</a><br/>
  &gt; install a LOT of packages to emacs<br/>
  &gt; spent months configuring emacs<br/>
  &gt; loving it<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; emacs have a ton of features<br/>
  &gt; too much features<br/>
  &gt; humongously bloat!<br/>
  &gt; not just ide level of bloat<br/>
  &gt; but os level of bloat<br/>
  &gt; even have a builtin file manager<br/>
  &gt; and tetris<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; slowly feel overwhelmed and exhausted in the emacs config rabbit hole<br/>
  &gt; still feel somewhat dissatisfied with the config...<br/>
</p>

> Learning about Emacs from XahLee's blogs, I discover [Xah Keyboard Guide](http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html), then of course learn about [XahLee's ErgoEmacs Keybinding](http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html) and [Ergoemacs-mode](https://ergoemacs.github.io), it's try to bind frequently used actions to easy to reach shortcut and use the commonly bound keys familiar to industry standard (e.g: <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">z</kbd> to undo, <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">s</kbd> to save). But it's heavy and breaks regularly, some of the binds I feel like missing or can be improved. So I decided to create [my own bindings](https://github.com/NNBnh/.emacs.d/blob/main/key.el), unknowingly kickstart a length journey...
>
> Because I want a better Emacs keybinds instead of except it's legacy design, I couldn't stand the default keybinds and spent way too much time and energy to learn as much about Lips and Emacs's actions to config... That is the reason why I feel exhausted and dissatisfied with Emacs. And also at the time, I didn't know about [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), an Emacs framework that doesn't bloat.

## [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; watching some linux stuff on yt<br/>
  &gt; saw some cool hackerman-looking text editor<br/>
  &gt; its vim<br/>
  &gt; pp love vim<br/>
  &gt; specifically neovim<br/>
  &gt; try it out<br/>
  &gt; its very fast and light<br/>
  &gt; feel like a hackerman<br/>
  &gt; config nvim<br/>
  &gt; week later<br/>
  &gt; wow somehow nvim is geting closer to become my dream editor faster than emacs<br/>
</p>

> Emacs keybinds are weird, but Vi binds are otherworldly strange! Many keys feel redundant, some frequently used actions are place in awkward places...
>
> Vim introduce me to modal text editing, it took a few days to get used to, after that, ... \[**Enlightenment~**\], editing feel like dancing my fingers on the keyboard!
>
> Vi binds ecosystem is huge with a lot of popular tools implementing it in one way or the other, one that learn Vi keys will benefit a lot by it's ecosystem. I of course ignoring it and continue my own keybinds saga.
>
> This time I decide to turn the keybinds from my custom config into a big project, I create [Bkey](https://github.com/NNBnh/bkey-old) its a universal keybinds system design for almost all applications. By define each key on the keyboard with a meanings, the applications can bind there own set of shortcuts/actions to fit those meanings.
>
> And come with it: [Bkey-Vim](https://github.com/NNBnh/bkey-vim) a Bkey implement for Vim.

## [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; saw <a class="text-success" href="https://youtu.be/sbfCSHhopT4">a video about kakoune by dt</a><br/>
  &gt; skeptical at first<br/>
  &gt; then realize its genius design<br/>
  &gt; switch editor for the third time<br/>
  &gt; kakoune is extremely minimalistic<br/>
  &gt; and have better default<br/>
  &gt; plus easier to config than previous editor<br/>
  &gt; its build from the ground up with <a class="text-success" href="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html">its philosophy</a><br/>
  &gt; e.g: object followed by verb (like how thing should be)<br/>
  &gt; multiple selections is the best things ever introduced to text editors<br/>
  &gt; its easy to understand, fast, convenient, orthogonal, flexible and powerful<br/>
  &gt; boy i can never go back to those non multi selections editor every again<br/>
</p>

> When switching to Kakoune, I decide to overhaul the Bkey project, rebrand it to [Bmap](https://github.com/NNBnh/bmap) and create [Bmap.kak](https://github.com/NNBnh/bmap.kak) a Bmap implement for Kakoune.

## Other TUI editors

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; i also try out other tui editors later on:<br/>
</p>

### [Helix](https://helix-editor.com)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; helix is like kakoune with builtin lsp tree sitter<br/>
  &gt; written in rust<br/>
  &gt; blazingly fast<br/>
</p>

<!-- > [TODO](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/1179) -->
<!-- > -->
> I try to make [Bmap-Helix](https://github.com/NNBnh/bmap-helix) (unfinished).

### [Pepper](https://vamolessa.itch.io/pepper)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; probably the best designed tui text editor that i know of<br/>
  &gt; its building up upon Kakoune philosophy<br/>
  &gt; but use caret style cursors (cursors can move past last line character and text is always inserted to its left)<br/>
  &gt; like cursors on any other gui apps<br/>
  &gt; its keybinds actions are elegantly and convenient<br/>
  &gt; pepper is bloat free<br/>
  &gt; its doesnt having any feature that could instead be implemented by integrating an external tool<br/>
  &gt; its more minimal than nvim and helix<br/>
  &gt; but still have enough features (like lsp support) out of the box unlike kakoune<br/>
  &gt; the downside its although pepper is open source<br/>
  &gt; its not free<br/>
  &gt; at the time i try it still very buggy and unpolish<br/>
</p>

> And of course I ertend to make [Bmap-Pepper](https://github.com/NNBnh/bmap-pepper) (unfinished).

## The problem with TUI

TODO
-->

## [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; thinking about switching back to gui editor<br/>
  &gt; then a desperate thought appear<br/>
  &gt; maybe vscode<br/>
  &gt; the normie editor<br/>
  &gt; is the answer<br/>
  &gt; install vscode<br/>
  &gt; probably the editor that come with the best default setting<br/>
  &gt; its not slow or heavy as pp said<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; its keybinds is industry standard<br/>
  &gt; multi selections in vscode is not as good as powerful as kakoune but still extremely good<br/>
  &gt; switching back to non modal editing feel a bit slow<br/>
  &gt; but for me its not a drop in productivity at all<br/>
  &gt; i still have my skill navigate with my trusty arrow keys<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; its have the best lps support<br/>
  &gt; and ton of other features<br/>
  &gt; yet none of it feel bloat<br/>
  &gt; vscodes plugins ecosystem is the biggest<br/>
  &gt; easy to learn and config<br/>
  &gt; start spending more time to code than tweaking the editor<br/>
  &gt; seem like its the most popular editor for reasons<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-success">
  &gt; while everyone share about how they switch from vscode to neovim and emacs<br/>
  &gt; i do this:<br/>
  &gt; emacs <code>-&gt;</code> neovim <code>-&gt;</code> kakoune <code>-&gt;</code> helix <code>-&gt;</code> pepper <code>-&gt;</code> vscode<br/>
  &gt; now that is a rare <code>$EDITOR</code> hopping<br/>
</p>
